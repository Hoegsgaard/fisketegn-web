(if stated), e-mail address (if stated), fishing number, type of fishing licence, validity period for fishing licences, registration date of the information and receipt code for payment.\n\nThe information about purchase of fishing licences is saved for 5 years after the purchase. If the fishing licence is renewed, the information is saved for 5 years from the date of renewal. If the fishing licence has not been used/renewed, the information will be deleted after 5 years.\n\nThe services of the homepage are in conformity with \"Act no. 227 of 22 April 2002 on Services in the information society, including certain aspects of electronic commerce\".

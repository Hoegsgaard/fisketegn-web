	Here you can buy recreational fisherman’s licences and angler’s licences, renew
	fishing licences and log in as a fisherman or a point of sale.<br />

	You are an angler if you fish with rod. You are a recreational fisherman if you
	fish with nets or other stationary tools.<br />

	of the page.<br />
	<br />
	All prices stated for fishing licences etc. include fees and costs of delivery. No
	VAT is levied on fishing licences.<br />

	If you buy a fishing licence, the system saves some pieces of information. This
	includes, among other things, name and address information, CPR no. (if
	stated), e-mail address (if stated), fishing number, type of fishing licence,
	validity period for fishing licences, registration date of the information and
	receipt code for payment.<br />
	<br />
	The information about purchase of fishing licences is saved for 5
	years after the purchase. If the fishing licence is renewed, the information is
	saved for 5 years from the date of renewal. If the fishing licence has not been
	used/renewed, the information will be deleted after 5 years.<br />
